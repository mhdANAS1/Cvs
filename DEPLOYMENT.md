# üöÄ Deployment Guide for Hostinger

This guide will help you deploy your CV Form application to Hostinger hosting platform.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Hostinger hosting account
- File Manager access or FTP credentials
- Domain name (optional, can use subdomain)

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Using Hostinger File Manager (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
Your production build is already ready in the `build` folder. The build contains:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `static/` folder - CSS, JavaScript, and assets
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `robots.txt` - SEO file
- `favicon.ico` - Website icon

#### Step 2: Access Hostinger Control Panel
1. Log in to your Hostinger account
2. Go to your hosting control panel
3. Navigate to "File Manager"

#### Step 3: Upload Files
1. In File Manager, navigate to the `public_html` folder (or your domain's root folder)
2. **Important**: Delete any existing `index.html` file if present
3. Upload all contents from the `build` folder to `public_html`
4. Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory

#### Step 4: Configure .htaccess (Optional but Recommended)
Create a `.htaccess` file in your `public_html` folder with this content:

```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]

# Enable compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</IfModule>

# Cache static assets
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/ico "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/icon "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType text/plain "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/pdf "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType text/xml "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/xml "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/xml+rss "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/atom+xml "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType text/javascript "access plus 1 month"
</IfModule>
```

### Method 2: Using FTP/SFTP

#### Step 1: Get FTP Credentials
1. In Hostinger control panel, go to "Files" ‚Üí "FTP Accounts"
2. Create a new FTP account or use existing credentials
3. Note down: Hostname, Username, Password, Port

#### Step 2: Use FTP Client
1. Download and install an FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
2. Connect using your FTP credentials
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder
4. Upload all contents from the `build` folder

### Method 3: Using Git (Advanced)

If you have Git hosting enabled:

1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. In Hostinger, go to "Git" in the control panel
3. Connect your repository
4. Set the deployment path to `public_html`
5. Deploy automatically on push

## üåê Domain Configuration

### Using Custom Domain
1. In Hostinger control panel, go to "Domains"
2. Add your domain or use existing one
3. Point it to your hosting account

2. Create a new subdomain (e.g., `cv.yourdomain.com`)
3. Point it to `public_html` folder
